# Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) â€” Common Aggregation Hierarchy of Subjects

The Higher Education Statistics Agency's (HESA) Common Aggregation Hierarchy (CAH) is a standardized classification system used in the United Kingdom to group together similar subjects across higher education institutions. It is used to facilitate the collection and reporting of data related to higher education, such as student enrollment, qualifications, and research activity. The CAH is organized into three levels of increasing specificity, with each level containing a number of subject areas.
